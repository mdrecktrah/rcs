# To-Dos:
- Build a proper interface (HTML?)
- Make user input (e.g. classes, races) more flexible in terms of how to write them (e.g. capitalizing)
    - Could be skipped with the interface, which can just include checkboxes and/or dropdowns
- Implement general error handling
- Implement random sex (or body type) for the character
- Add focus spec for talents
- Add random name generator

# Version history

## Version 0.1 - 2023/08/XX
First working version of the program, but still missing proper error handling. Functionality include:
- Set the number of characters you want to be created.
- Choose faction: Alliance, Horde or random choice.
- Further filtering possibilities: Race, Spec Type, Classes.
    - Race and Class combinations according to WoW Classic. You can check out all combinations on [WoWHead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classic-wow-classes-and-talent-overview#class-race-combinations) or many other sites. Sorry, but no Night Elf Paladins here!
- After all your filters have been set (or... not set), the program will randomize every open possibility and print a list with as many characters as you set in the beginning. Enjoy your leveling experience! =)
