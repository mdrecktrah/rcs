# RCS - Random Character Selector
In preparation of a gaming session with a friend for the start of WoW Classic Hardcore servers, we once again stood before one of the hardest decisions to make:

__What characters do we choose?__

In order to help ourselves with this question, I coded the Random Character Selector - or RCS in short. I'm sure there are quite a few of those out there, but I also just wanted to use my current beginner Python skills =)

My aim is to help the uncreative, the non-decisive, the adventurous, and those who just want to try a new class/character in World of Warcraft but cannot decide which one. This program shall help you to create one or more random characters. If you have a couple of preferences - like if you definitely want to play Horde (Lok'tar ogar!) - there will be some filters that you can set. After all questions have been answered, you have your very own list of characters to choose from. Now go out there and enjoy the game!

This very first version will only support WoW Classic.

## How to start the script
The RCS can be started like every other python script. Simply download the _rcs.py_ file and start up your terminal. In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved the .py file and run the command `python rcs.py`. Of course, make sure to have python installed on your system ;) <br>
Alternatively: Look for an online python interpreter (e.g. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)) and just copy the code from _rcs.py_ in there and run it.

Written and tested with Python 3.11.4.
